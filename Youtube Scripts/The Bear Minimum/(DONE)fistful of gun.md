Hi! I’m Bear. Welcome to the Bear Minimum where I introduce a cool item that I think everyone should know about, or try. This episode is for an indie game called “A Fistful of Gun.” Let’s go.

a Fistful of gun is a top down shootem up style game by Paul “Farmergnome” Hart.

It’s two parts bullet hell to one part adventure game.

I find it reminiscent of classic NES games like Jackal, or Heavy Barrel
	and you can see the similarities, but A Fistful of gun takes it to the next
	level with some modern twists. 

Unique weapon mechanics, a robust cast of characters, cool power-ups,
classic villains, a great story, and a hectic multiplayer. It’s everything you could
ever want in a shoot’em up style game, and each level is executed flawlessly.

Each character comes with a weapon, and each weapon has a unique control scheme.

This makes every character fun to explore as you learn their capabilities as well as their
	shortcomings and with so many characters there’s a lot of replay value here.

On a note of replay value the story mode in the game offers a multitude of routes, each of
	which with their own consequences, good and bad. Finding the best and most fun
	routes to victory will keep you coming back for more.

Another thing of note that in a world of hand holding and coddling A Fistful of Gun doesn’t
pull any punches… er… bullets… well some guys punch you.. regardless this
game is brutal.

Don’t expect to get very far on your first try, but the game does a good job of getting you
	right back into the action so you can try again. No long annoying loads
	no unskippable cutscenes. Just a heart wrenching countdown to 0 as you 
	realize you’re out of continues.

As far as music goes? Well listen. 

Awesome high energy chiptunes music that reminds you constantly how completely insane
	everything around you really is.

a Fistful of gun is out now on Steam, Good old games, and the humble store. You can check out the links in the description below.



Do yourself a favor and give this one a try, if you’re a schmups like me then you
can’t miss A Fistful of gun.

And that’s the bear minimum.
