## Gameplay Ideas
### Core Features
These features MUST be in the game for it to be considered "complete"

### Stretch Ideas
These features CAN be included but are not REQUIRED for game to be considered "complete"

- Map will highlight “metroidvania” elements (think cyberpunk?) and will be associated with phrases: “I wish I could jump that high…” or “This is just barely too high for me to reach right now.” so that players can associate the colors with their abilities (which will be color coded in the menus as well!)
  - Stretch additions for map highlight: might be prudent to change the phrases to “I think I could probably reach that now…” when repeating a visit to a highlighted map point
- Each Beast has it’s own Digipedia entry that players can fill by observing and battling with the beast. Once a Digipedia entry reaches a certain threshold players can create a Digi from the data that can be called anytime from then on
- Additional entries will change the stats and available abilities of that Digi when it’s rerolled or “rebooted.” Many “bonus” features like colors behaviors movements and small unique looks are included in the collectable data including things like enjoying to smell flowers or chase birds, do flips etc.
- Quests are available to be picked up all the time through a smart device and if you have it set up it will notify you when a quest target is nearby
  - These quests basically take the place of “grinding” so instead of fighting wild beasts for no reason (exp) you get next to nothing from these battles unless they’re done intentionally.
  - More quests are available when you travel to places where people are
- Capturing enough data for a beast in order to make a “perfect” digi is a puzzle
  - Reading through their encyclopedia entry has many hints that will easily get you across the “production threshold” but in order to perfect a digi it requires a lot more sleuthing to find out what they need. I don’t want it to be so obscure that you can never find it without looking it up but It shouldn’t obvious or easy to accomplish.
- Battles are frequent and fun (core to gameplay) and help flesh out the world and get the player money (win or lose doesn’t matter)

## Progression IDEAS
- Exp by doing research, completing quests, and battling trainers and wild beasts. Very Pokemon.
- At certain exp milestones the trainer will level up. This will automatically increase the potential of all of your Digis without needing to reboot them. Any newly booted Digi doesn’t need to be trained they will always be the same level as the trainer.
- Unique leveling mechanic? (monster hunter HR?)
- At first your range of exploration will be limited but as you reach level milestones more areas online resources via Digipedia and contacts become available to you. These new contacts may have urgent missions for you to undertake that will progress the story. You may be challenged by a powerful trainer or take on a special mission. Very monster hunter.
- As you explore you’ll find many paths are blocked by various obstacles. You must journey far and wide seeking out DD Masters that hold the key to unlocking the abilities you need to explore these often valuable and more often integral areas. Very metroid.

## Environment & Areas IDEAS
### Cities
- Cities should have many metroidvania elements (blocked by upgrade) and lots of characters to interact with as well as exploration

## Accessibility
- Dedicated button that allows players to change their control or their gameplay settings and swap between two modes quickly and efficiently so that The accessibility settings are more granular and can accommodate minute by minute changes to ability.
- Accessibility first design. If you can’t make it accessible it shouldn’t be in the game. Consider getting help for this.
- One touch platforming: lets players skip jump puzzles
- Autotravel: choosing a destination lets you autotravel instead of fast travel if you’d like to see the sights
- Players can adjust the difficulty of enemies at will (even mid battle)
- Warning: “If one or more these options don’t make the game more fun for you please don’t use them. They allow the broadest range of players to enjoy the game as much as possible.”
- Menu options to turn off the “level playing field” which allows players to “overlevel” instead of every encounter being automatically equal to their trainer level. (overlevel is limited to 5 levels to keep it interesting while making it very easy to overpower every encounter.)
- Possible to put in an “autowin” style that doesn’t skip the battles but makes them impossible to lose?
- "running" from a battle can't fail. Yes even bosses.
Who can help me discover blind spots in this part of the process?
