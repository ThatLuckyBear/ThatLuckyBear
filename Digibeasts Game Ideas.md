## Gameplay
Map will highlight “metroidvania” elements (think cyberpunk?) and will be associated with phrases: “I wish I could jump that high…” or “This is just barely too high for me to reach right now.” so that players can associate the colors with their abilities (which will be color coded in the menus as well!)
Stretch additions for map highlight: 
might be prudent to change the phrases to “I think I could probably reach that now…” when repeating a visit to a highlighted map point
Each Beast has it’s own Digipedia entry that players can fill by observing and battling with the beast.
Once a Digipedia entry reaches a certain threshold players can create a Digi from the data that can be called anytime from then on
Additional entries will change the stats and available abilities of that Digi when it’s rerolled or “rebooted”
Many “extraneous” features like colors behaviors movements and small unique looks are included in the collectable data including things like enjoying to smell flowers or chase birds, do flips etc.
