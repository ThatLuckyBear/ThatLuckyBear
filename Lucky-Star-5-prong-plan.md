I've been thinking really long term and this might be where I end up aiming my efforts:   

1. Acting lessons
2. Whisper booth for at home voiceover work
3. Learn game dev and make projects for fun
4. Write and self publish articles
5. Do a voice version of those articles on a new Youtube Channel

Seems like a lot but the variety is solid to cover for my meandering attention and everything wraps in voiceover which will be the core of my efforts (hence the acting and large investment in recording equipment) I could (and may) expand my article writing into books + audiobooks but it depends on whether that becomes something I really want to do.
