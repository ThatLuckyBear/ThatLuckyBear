# Bread Quest

## concept
Bread Quest is a game that empowers the player to fulfill the ultimate modern power fantasy. Dress up, be pretty, and eat breads.

### setting
a paradise world where bakerys and clothing stores are not only plentiful they're the entire economic system. There are many markets each with their own collection of shops. shops and even markets to some degree vary in style taking inspiration from every culture and their own love of bread and fashion. Eager to share with others merchants and other customers are always encouraging, helpful, and inviting.
All transportation is handled by the wonderfully reliable and free public transportation system.

### gameplay loops
Gameplay is separated into four major loops of different lengths. Daily (morning/noon/night,) weekly (Sun through Sat,) seasonal (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter,) and Yearly (Year 1, 2 3, etc.) Each day/week/season act as repeating routines within the a yearly loop. Years are outside of the loop and acts as a progression. each year will differ from the last in sometimes unexpected ways.

#### daily loop
Phase one the player checks the weather, goes through their wardrobe and dresses for the day. Players can optionally look at the schedules of people or shops they're familiar with to plan out their day. Next the player journeys out to a market of their choice and explores. Time passes and shops open and close and NPCs pass through. Players peruse breads and decide which to have. Merchants may suggest optional pairings with tea or coffee or other beverages. Players talk with others and may be approached by someone who is curious about their bread, or want to compliment their outfit. Players can also peruse fashion and beauty boutiques that offer hair, makeup and clothing of all kinds. 

#### weekly loop
Stores and NPCs have schedules they adhere to, you can't see every person or store every day. Players can build their calendar by taking notes of posted shop hours, and asking special NPCs when they'll be around. Building and checking these schedules is helpful when players have specific goals for their day but is optional.

#### seasonal loop
seasons change what kinds of market items are available. Rainy days in the spring expand umbrella options, hats with wide brim in summer, jackets for fall and gloves and scarves in winter. Breads will have seasonal flavors, poppy seed in spring, pumpkin in fall. Delicious options like soup in a bread bowls in winter. Each season has events based on real world events that have special items you can only obtain in that season once a year. 

#### yearly progression (not a loop)
as the game progresses players will find the world expanding and new events tied to unique marketplaces and NPCs. Things change with time, shops may go out of business after a few years or NPCs may move from one market to another. Each year brings new surprises, some happy and some sad. some can be resolved by player involvement and some are just part of the world moving through time the player can be witness to.

### Game mechanics

#### Bread Journal
Players are encouraged to hunt down and try every kind of bread in the game. Over 400 kinds of bread!! (idk how many breads there are.) Players have a "Bread Journal" which tracks each kind of bread they've eaten with timestamped entries for each time they've eaten it. This bread journal also has partial entries of bread they've seen others eating in public, with more details about where they might get their own it if they go out of their way to talk with an NPC about it. The Bread journal also has mysterious blank entries that can be investigated individually as part of a larger quest.

#### fashion journal
Much like the bread journal the fashion journal is continually filled with fashion items including hair makeup and clothes. Unlike the bread journal the fashion journal does not require you to purchase an article to complete its entry. This way you can keep your closet uncluttered and functional while still completing the journal. Players can learn more about fashion in the same interactions as with the bread journal, seeing and talking with those who have them on, or when they're on display to learn more. Special mysterious fashion articles are again waiting to be discovered and investigated. 

#### Gossip Grapevine
While out you can talk with NPCs. Your fashion or meal might inspire NPCs to approach you either on transportation, while you explore, or while you're enjoying your meal. Through these chats you can meet important characters who are involved in small or broader narrative beats as well as passerby who just want to tell you they love your shoes. Interactions might start a quest, give players info for journals, or introduce new concepts or pursuits. Players can also approach NPCs anytime and get some basic information about their meal or fashion, or just tell the NPC that they love their shoes. 

#### Quests
Bread Quest is not just about questing for bread, sometimes the bread is a quest in itself. merchants may need ingredients, help making deliveries or other kinds of requests. Quests will always result in a reward ranging from journal updates all the way to access speciality breads or fashion. Some quests are part a series that lead to a larger reward. In later years new quests become available like helping citizens you've gotten to know do things like open a new bread stand, prevent their store from closing, or help them work through some kind of life challenge.

## Development Ideas
To map development many decisions need to be made. Everything here is in flux until prototyping stages narrow to the final choices.

### gamefeel
Movement is deliberate, smooth, and efficient. Walking should feel fast enough without needing a sprinting state. Imagine a long intentional stride that feels like the player is moving with intention but not hurrying.
Menus should be snappy but in universe. Journal browsing come from a bag (opening instantly but character pulls their journal from a bag to look at it. when browsing a store you look in the bake case or a print menu. Fashion preview is handled by seeing into player character's imagination as they look through the options.
