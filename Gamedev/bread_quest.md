# Bread Quest

## concept
Bread Quest is a game that empowers the player to fulfill the ultimate modern power fantasy. Dress up, be pretty, and eat breads.

## setting
a paradise world where bakerys and clothing stores are not only plentiful they're the entire economic system. There are many markets each with their own collection of shops. shops and even markets to some degree vary in style taking inspiration from every culture and their own love of bread and fashion. Eager to share with others merchants and other customers are always encouraging, helpful, and inviting.
- All transportation is handled by the wonderfully reliable and free public transportation system and bicycles.
- Cakes, donuts, and other baked goods aren't really part of the world (scope limit, I'd by hyped by a "donut DLC pack" though)
- corespondance is handled through mail
- no internet
- body types and hair types need to be vast and as inclusive as possible

## gameplay loops
Gameplay is experienced across 3 loops: Daily (morning/noon/night,) weekly (Sun through Sat,) seasonal (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter.) There are also years (Year 1, 2 3, etc.) Each day/week/season act as repeating routines within the a yearly loop with some variation across years which progress the game in sometimes unexpected ways.

#### daily loop
Player gets ready for their day. Checking the weather, checking their calendar to make a plan, and dress up for the day. When leaving the house they can gather any new mail. Next the player journeys (train/bus/bicycle) out to a market of their choice. They can read their mail during the journey but they'll have lots of opportunities waiting in line or sitting around. When players arrive at their destination they walk about and explores executing on their mental plan. Time passes and shops open and close and NPCs pass through as players go about their business, interacting if they'd like. Players peruse bread shops and decide which to have. Merchants may suggest optional pairings with tea or coffee or other beverages (limited to a handful of simple options.) Players may sometimes be approached by someone who is curious about their bread, or want to compliment their outfit. Players can also peruse fashion and beauty boutiques that offer hair, makeup and clothing of all kinds. Players can at any time check their journal for quest information and act on those objectives on a whim if they're in the right place. As the day winds down players make their way back home. They don their pajamas decide whether to jot down a note about thier day in the journal and go to bed.

#### weekly loop
Stores and NPCs have schedules they adhere to, you can't see every person or store every day. Players can build their calendar by taking note of posted shop hours, and asking special NPCs when they'll be around. Building and checking these schedules is helpful when players have specific goals for their day but is optional. Some events and schedules can be set to populate the calendar automatically.

#### seasonal loop
seasons change what kinds of market items and events are available. Rainy days in the spring might expand umbrella options, hats with wide brims pop up in summer, jackets for fall and gloves and scarves in winter. Some bread shops may have seasonal flavors like poppy seed in spring, or pumpkin in fall or special options like soup in a bread bowl in winter. Each season has events based on real world, and imagined events that have special items you can only obtain in that season once a year. 

#### yearly progression (not a loop)
as the game progresses players will find the world expanding and new events tied to unique marketplaces and NPCs. Things change with time, shops may go out of business after a few years or NPCs may move from one market to another. Each year brings new surprises, some happy and some sad. some can be resolved by player involvement and some are just part of the world moving through time the player can be witness to.

## Game mechanics
Some mechanics listed are core to the game concept while others are supplementary. Core mechanics are needed as the game wouldn't really be "the game" without them. Supplementary ideas are more like bonus mechanics that are intended to add flavor or fun to the experience. These categories are in flux like most everything else.

### Time (core)
Time passes in game at a fairly leisurly pace. Time can be moved more quickly by relaxing or reading (books/mail) pretty much anywhere players can sit down. Menus do not pause the game and time will pass while players are having conversations. Players might get interrupted if they're holding up a line, or conversations might end if players idle too long. A separate "PAUSE" is available which stops time properly but you can't engage with the game during that time. Players can also make adjustments to the passage of time if needed, setting the time to move more slowly or quickly if it increases enjoyment. Gameplay happens mostly from in game times of 8am to 11pm but players can "get up early" and "stay up late" if they have a good reason to!

### Journal (core)
The player keeps track of quests, breads, fashion, and more with their journal. Players will spend a lot of time navigating this menu but it shouldn't vy for the players attention. No notifications or bubbles to pull players away from what they're doing. Players are encouraged to take notes in the journal but it's entirely optional.

### Eating Bread (core)
Eating in Bread Quest is not about hunger it's about satisfaction, exploration, and progression. Learning about breads and finding your favorites can be fun and the information also helps you engage with the world. Sometimes just enjoying a new bread can expand your access to new areas, shops, and more.

### Bread Journal (core)
Players are encouraged to hunt down and try all kinds of bread in the game. Over 400 kinds of bread!! (idk how many breads there are but bigger number better game?) Players have a "Bread Journal" which tracks each kind of bread they've eaten with timestamped entries for each time they've eaten it. This bread journal also has partial entries of bread they've seen others eating in public. Players can get more details about where they can try these breads if they go out of their way to talk with an NPC about it. The Bread journal also has mysterious blank entries that can be investigated individually as part of a larger quest.

### Dress Up (supplementary)
Players have a wardrobe they can access anytime to change their clothes. Flowy dresses, blouses, comfy pants, and big hats are the default for style but options go well beyond those basic "cottage core" vibe . Game events will encourage players to explore styles or aesthetics and players will constantly discover many new clothes to express themselves.

### fashion journal (supplementary)
Much like the bread journal the fashion journal is continually filled with fashion items including hair makeup and clothes. Unlike the bread journal the fashion journal does not require you to purchase an article to complete its entry. This way the closet can stay uncluttered and functional while still completing the journal. Players can learn more about fashion in the same style of interactions as the bread journal. You can talk to NPCS about their style or just inspect their style from afar. Store fronts have clothing as well that can expand journal entries. Special mysterious fashion articles are again waiting to be discovered and investigated. 

### Exploring the Grapevine (core)
While out you can talk with NPCs. Your fashion or meal might inspire NPCs to approach you either on transportation, while you explore, or while you're enjoying your meal. Through these chats you can meet important characters who are involved in small or broader narrative beats as well as passerby who just want to tell you they love your shoes. Interactions might start a quest, give players info for journals, or introduce new concepts or pursuits. Players can also approach NPCs anytime and get some basic information about their meal or fashion, or just tell the NPC that they love their shoes. 

### Furniture (supplementary)
While not as customizable you can get new furnishing and display it in your home. Things like a new mirror, an extended wardrobe, a nightstand, a vanity, etc. Some of these furnishings are attached to mechanics like being able to do simple nail or hair styles at home instead of always going to the salon. 

### Calendar (core)
Instead of having an automatic or wildly complex automated event calendar players handle it in gameplay. It will be in their journal so they can access it and edit it whenever they'd like. Players will unlock stickers they can use to mark events on dates as they learn them. Players can even create "auto" stickers by assigning a sticker type from premade categories and enabling the option to add those stickers automatically when discovered. Players can make their own legend, but only premade categories can be automated. Available stickers can be expanded through gameplay.
#### Examples:
  - An NPC might say "I'm here at the cafe on Tuesdays." and players can create a repeating sticker for that day labeled "Jack at Wisp Cafe on Tuesdays."
  - Players can put a sticker with a note for an opening day of a new store that they saw from a flyer
  - Players can also use stickers to mark a memorable occaision with a note for a single sticker instead of assigning a sticker to a category in the legend.

### Quests (core)
Bread Quest is not just about questing for bread, sometimes the bread was the quest all along. Merchants may need ingredients, help making deliveries or other kinds of requests. Quests will always result in a reward like currency, journal updates, or access to speciality breads or fashion. Some quests are part a series that lead to a larger reward or narrative payoff. In later years new quests become available like helping citizens. Some might want to open a new bakery, some may want to create a delivery service or open a bread stand by importing breads from other markets. Some quests might be about preventing a store from closing. Others might be focused on an NPCs personal challenges.
#### Quest Ideas:
- look after sour dough starter for a few weeks "feeding it" every few days
- small "I want this kind of flavor/texture" puzzles that rewards a well filled journal
- fashion/styling contests
- connecting merchants with suppliers that help them expand their offerings
- spreading an idea to make a style of bread popular

### Progression
To keep things interesting and give players a "point" things need to change with time. Progression will add new fun things to the game. Many will be automatic but some can be influenced by player input.
#### Progression ideas:
- discover New Areas
- discover New Shops
- Rebrands of old shops (player influenced?)
- access to new wardrobe options
- access to a bicycle
- new customization options
- new friendships/npcs to meet (or who want to meet you after being interesting but distant)
- being allowed into previously exclusive areas

### Narrative
The game follows the player who has moved out on their own for the first time. Their new home is in a village just outside a city they've never been to before. The player character chose this area specifically because a group of their childhood friends moved there some time ago and they encouraged the player to come too through their letters. One of these friends let the player know a new spot is available and they were encouraged to make a bid. In the envelope theres a photo of the home and it's quaint and beautiful. The player packs up their favorite clothes and spends their first night in their new home with dreams of what life their new home will introduce.

Upon waking players meet their neighbors, learn how to get around, and start exploring. From there the narrative takes a bit of a back seat as players just enjoy the world. Smaller stories unfold constantly through quests of all kinds which help players learn about others and their troubles and their new home.

A broader narrative slowly unfolds about the player's place in the community. The story revolves around players finding themselves and what's important to them. How do you like to dress? What do you value? What do you provide for those around you? The player character shifts from an individualistic mindset to a community mindset. They learn with time how valuable it is to not only enjoy things but also enjoy caring for others and being depended upon.

There is an unspoken meta commentary underlying the entire game which feels post-capitalist or semi-utopian. Players can do quests (work) to earn and spend currency as much as they want but always get a monthly stipend by mail no matter how much currency they have. However the most important or desireable things are never obtainable via currency. Lot's of the best clothing and breads and furnishings are given to you by others. Sometimes given as payment for completing a quest but just as often for no reason other than kindness, or as reciprication of kindness the player exhibits. Homes, transportation, and other basic needs are handled by an unseen organizing force. This enables the player (and others) to do what they want rather than what is required for surival. It's a world where abundance is not taken for granted but instead is expansive and put to good use as much as possible. While it isn't explicitly stated this is a world where the basic needs of everyone are so thoroughly provided that underhanded actions can't reasonably improve anyone's conditions enough to really be worth doing.

#### Ideas for in game events
- pajama day in town
- falltime cocoa and movie night
- flower festival with NPC flower sculpture contest
- travelling merchants coming into town
- bus breaks down and players can help

### Postgame
While the story is the core of the experience players can work on completing the bread journal and fashion journal. There are a large number of entries that will not be required to complete the game and players can continue to solve puzzles and make discoveries long after the credits roll if they wish. New Game + is also something I'd love to explore with players carrying their journals forward (without key items for story progression) to enjoy the game with even more options at their disoposal from the very start.

## Development Ideas
To map development many decisions need to be made. Everything here is in flux until prototyping stages narrow to the final choices.

### gamefeel
Movement is deliberate, smooth, and efficient. Walking should feel fast enough without needing a sprinting state. Imagine a long intentional stride that feels like the player is moving with intention but not hurrying.
Menus should be snappy but in universe. Journal browsing come from a bag (opening instantly but character pulls their journal from a bag to look at it. when browsing a store you look in the bake case or a print menu. Fashion preview is handled by seeing into player character's imagination as they look through the options. 

### graphics style
I envision a simple visual language in a 3d world with simple fabric physics. While moving fabrics should flow somewhat but more animated than simulated. While not fully ps1/ps2 era graphics something limited in realism and more stylized would be ideal. UI elements should be minimal. Contrast and sightlines highlight important places instead quest markers or ui elements. If an NPC has something to say they will wave to or approach players instead of having a big quest marker or thought bubble. Menus should be environmental as often as possible ordering food is done with a paper menu on screeen being picked up before presented, looking into a glass bake case is another disguised menu. Dialogue should be handled with minimal ui as well but there will have to be a split difference because readability and accessibility should always win out over aesthetics.

### Example In Game Day
Player wakes up, gets dressed, checks calendar. In the calendar a sticker labeled "new shop opening, bring coupon." Player exits their home and checks the mail, a letter from Ma, and Pa. Player goes to bus, picks route, talks with a neighbor going the same way at the stop, hops off at destination. Some impromptu conversations occur as player walks down the street. Player gets gifted a small sample bread they haven't tried before which updates their journal. They get in line at the new bread store, there's only a few people ahead of the player and they get to chatting. Each time the dialogue progresses they move forward. While in line waiting the player can see into the bake case and can choose ahead of time what they want. At the front the player orders their bread and the person taking the coupon is the owner. They talk about a problem and the player offers to help. They say they're busy but they'll be done around 5pm if the player wants to come back to talk about it. The player opens their journal and adds a small sticker with a reminder to check back with the owner of the new shop. From there the player finds a nice spot to sit and enjoy their bread and they read their letter. Nobody approaches them today during their mealtime, probably because the new shop has people busy. After eating their bread and deciding to move on they go to the bike shop to talk to the owner on a whim. There's a quest here to get a bike but the player isn't established enough to start it so they get a bit of a generic response. After they see one of the workers who does repairs at the bike shop. They look frustrated and they're muttering to themselves. Player decide they want to help them and offer to give them a hand. The worker says yes and the player gets a new bread quest. The quest synopsis outlines a few hints for the player of where they might start but it's pretty open ended and there are more than a handful of stores they could check for the solution. While figuring out the quest the player is handed a small flyer for a new baked good coming to a shop they've been to before. They mark it in their calendar and continue on. They player realizes they've gone too deep in the repair worker's quest to make it back in time to meet the owner but the quest just rolls over to the next day so nothing is lost. (quests with specific time requirements are obviously marked and timed) On the bus ride home one of the other riders on the bus asks the player about their haircut and the player tells them about the salon they go to. The person is delighted and thanks them by giving them a coupon for another bread store, the player notes the expiration date in their journal. Upon arriving at home the player changes into their pajamas and go to bed. Before falling asleep they're prompted to put a little note in their journal about the day if they'd like. Then they turn out the lights and go to bed ready for another day.
