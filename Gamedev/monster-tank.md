## the yoink

it's a metroidvania that bites hard on blaster Master without the on foot sections and leans heavily into the gunplay/upgrade/equip aspect (hollow Knight)

## the twist
the tank is biological in nature and the enemies and world are very wild. everything is "what if technology was bugs?"
