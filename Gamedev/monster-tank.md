# monster tank

## the yoink

it's a metroidvania that bites hard on blaster Master without the on foot sections and leans heavily into the gunplay/upgrade/equip aspect (hollow Knight)

## the twist
the tank is biological in nature and the enemies and world are very wild. everything is "what if technology was bugs?" 

## Tank
#### tank ideas
- tank shoots guns out of the front and can aim up/down/left/right and hits in an arc in front of it
- tank is also a monster and can "melee" which means it bites things that are close for extra damage
  - stealth melee on unaware enemies can one hit KO (tank eat's them)
  - eating/melee kills give a bonus to gun damage (8 levels?) that you lose one level of each time you're hit
  - eating also restores health
- tank can be upgraded (metroidvania required upgrades)
  - double jump (extra bio legs)
  - Floating by shooting down (limited by a separate "ammo" list)
  - wall stick
  - smell o' vision (finding way through maze, bonus uses to find treasures)
  - digging (certain terrain, bonus uses to find cool items or edible grubs to level up gun and/or get hp)
  - frog mode (move through water/other water-like terrains)
  - turbo mode (gotta go fast, also break walls, also bash into stuff so things fall down
- tank has standard that can be upgraded (bonus optional upgrades)
  - tank power increase
  - HP max increase
  - ammo max increase
  - lots of colors
  - more slots for equipment
- tank has extra equipment that alter the way the tank functions (HK charms)
  - limited by "slots"
  - faster movement
  - more defense (less offense)
  - more offense (less defense)
  - slow recover on HP or gun
  - increased gun fire rate
  - increase melee fire rate
  - no gun but melee increased power LOTS
  - no melee but gun increased power and replaces melee boons with in world HP/GUN drops
  - gun meter depletes over time but bonuses are increased significantly
  - HP boost
  - GUN boost (new levels for bonus guns)
  - HP is always depleting but melee always kills and refills HP to full
- tank has equipment slots for alt-fire weapons (one at a time, unless equip slots are upgraded) has ammo you need to collect
  - homing missiles (shoot bees) that lockon, cycle targets with (button) fire with (hold button)
  - sword tongue that increases melee effectiveness
  - stealth spores (lose aggro, opens up stealth bonuses mid-combat)
  - passive counterattack (automatic but only activates when you take damage)
  - spiderweb net (slows enemies who are hit by an aoe)
