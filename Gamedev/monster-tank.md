# monster tank

## the yoink

it's a metroidvania that bites hard on blaster Master without the on foot sections and leans heavily into the gunplay/upgrade/equip aspect (hollow Knight)

## the twist
the tank is biological in nature and the enemies and world are very wild. everything is "what if technology was bugs?" 

## Tank ideas
- tank shoots guns out of the front and can aim up/down/left/right and hits in an arc in front of it
- tank is also a monster and can "melee" which means it bites things that are close for extra damage
  - stealth melee on unaware enemies can one hit KO (tank eat's them)
  - eating/melee kills give a bonus to gun damage (8 levels?) that you lose one level of each time you're hit
  - eating also restores health
#### tank can be upgraded (metroidvania required upgrades)
  - double jump (extra bio legs)
  - Floating by shooting down (limited by a separate "ammo" list)
  - wall stick
  - smell o' vision (finding way through maze, bonus uses to find treasures)
  - digging (certain terrain, bonus uses to find cool items or edible grubs to level up gun and/or get hp)
  - frog mode (move through water/other water-like terrains)
  - turbo mode (gotta go fast, also break walls, also bash into stuff so things fall down
  - autofloat (you can aim while floating)
  - infinity jump (jump forever)
#### tank has standard that can be upgraded (bonus optional upgrades)
  - tank power increase
  - HP max increase
  - ammo max increase
  - lots of colors
  - more slots for equipment
#### tank has extra equipment that alter the way the tank functions (HK charms)
  - limited by "slots"
  - faster movement
  - more defense (less offense)
  - more offense (less defense)
  - slow recover on HP or gun
  - increased gun fire rate
  - increase melee fire rate
  - no gun but melee increased power LOTS
  - no melee but gun increased power and replaces melee boons with in world HP/GUN drops
  - gun meter depletes over time but bonuses are increased significantly
  - HP boost
  - GUN boost (new levels for bonus guns)
  - HP is always depleting but melee always kills and refills HP to full
#### tank has equipment slots for alt-fire weapons (one at a time, unless equip slots are upgraded) has ammo you need to collect
  - homing missiles (shoot bees) that lockon, cycle targets with (button) fire with (hold button)
  - sword tongue that increases melee effectiveness
  - stealth spores (lose aggro, opens up stealth bonuses mid-combat)
  - passive counterattack (automatic but only activates when you take damage)
  - spiderweb net (slows enemies who are hit by an aoe)

## levels

### field of flowers
#### setting
- flowers eat you
- bees try to kill you
- pretty standard with learner gaps and enemies for practicing
#### metroidvania
- unmakable gap falling down and getting the floatgun upgrade
- use it to platform back up and reach the initial gap
#### boss
- big flower
- creates danger zones on the floor you need to avoid with float

### dark forest
#### setting
- angry trees
- angrier beetles
- mushrooms on the north side of trees (angry also)
- entering and exiting trees
- hidden enemies in bark (they melee stealth attack the player)
- areas just barely too high to reach with float
#### metroidvania
- wall cling required to progress 
- stealth spores unlocked if you explore well but it's not really "required"
#### boss
- big beetle
- can only be hit from behind
- stealth is the easiest way though he will let his guard down from time to time

### underground caves
#### setting
- maze
- undead (unkillable) skeleton rodents with swords
- rodent necromancer you can see but can't reach/find
- dark area (navigable but not easily)
#### metroidvania
- smell vision
- you can see items underground but can't get them
- catch the scent of the rodent necromancer by catching them offguard and picking up their scent
- clear a maze
- you get digging at the end
#### boss
- the maze is the boss
- rat necromancer is the target
- you one shot him in the final room
- unlocks digging

___ GAME IS NO LONGER LINEAR UNTIL FINAL AREA ____

### FIND DOUBLE JUMP
Player has to explore using their new abilities and backtracking to find the double jump upgrade which they would have seen pretty easily but had been unable to reach until now. After double jump is unlocked the player can find some "alters" from the beginning of the game. 4 bosses need to be defeated to progress past these alters but the player would have already defeated the rat necromancer whose alter is already moved out of the way as a hint.

### underground ocean
#### setting
- get here by digging in a special area in caves that was cut off by double jump/float puzzle
- its all water and angry fish and plants and bugs as usual
#### metroidvania
- get frog mode immediately
- enter a specific wide open area player is swallowed by giant whale
#### boss
- fight your way out of the whale
- frogmode lets you pass through weird gelatenous floating things as part of the platforming

### Metal Mines 
#### setting
- oddly technological but still biological
- alien plants and rodents with plantbased cybernetics
- machines doing "things" that are vaguely threatening
- first place that isn't angry despite the danger
#### metroidvania
- turbomode unlocks halfway and lets you blast through walls
- lots of cool unlocks that were unobtainable and some hidden items that can be "bonked" out of their hiding place
#### monster tank
- its not you but it is the same thing that you are
- defeat it with any means necessary, many of the attacks it uses will be similar to the bosses in that they have a mechanical component
- cannot be stealthed bc it too has smellovision
- btw it can stealth you so get your smellovision on

### Fire Fields
#### setting
- its just the first flower fields area but on fire
- also there was a massive destruction so there are far more platforming elements
- enemies are mostly monster tanks and flying monster helicopters
  - nowhere near as scary as the boss monster tank but threatening
#### metroidvania
- everything is unlocked now but every power will be put to the test here
#### boss
- megatank
- first speaking boss, a human tells you that what you're doing is wrong and you need to stop
- monster tank is feral and talking does nothing
- human (he is very smol) gets in their "tank" and it transforms into a huge mecha

### The Surface
#### setting
- you realize through background windows that everything took place underground as you climb up to the surface
- mini bosses guard doors as you clear each one it opens
- the final door opens out to a large surface world with buildings and other modern structures
- all the enemies you faced are expirements and your escape threatens humanity's survival
#### metroidvania
- tons of optional exploration and lots of really tricky optional platforming for rewards
- you unlock the final upgrade for infinite jumps and autofloat (you can aim freely while you float)
#### boss
- the final boss unfolds in stages
- stage 1 army: you have to defeat an army of varied attackers across a giant battlefield requiring advanced usage of all the unlocks
- stage 2 containment: you're locked in a cage that's trying to kill you
- stage 3 nuke launch: where you try (and fail) to defeat all the monsters before they launch a nuke
- stage 4 disarm nuke: infinite jump up to the nuke and fight through it to disarm it before it lands
- stage 5 final boss: is the disarmed nuke lands and when you exit the final boss emerges
- Omegatank is similar to the boss from firefields in concept but is obviously much stronger and larger and has an enormous number of attacks that take advantage of all the expirimental tech that you have been fighting through this entire time


## Game ideas
### story
- you are an escaped monster tank from a lab
- "they" will do anything to get you back/stop you
- survive and slowly realize that everything you've been fighting is an expirement
- the monster tank was supposed to be the culmination of that tech, becoming an ultimate weapon
- you're not the first but you're the first they lost control of
- things escalate in unpredictable ways until you defeat omegatank
- the ending is somewhat open ended for interpretation but the tank is free in the world to do as it will

### game modes
- new game plus where you keep all your stuff but everything is retuned to make the game interesting
- speedrun mode - you can start the game with a few user selected options (equip to start with, skip cutscenes, etc)
- challenge mode - no equipment / other restrictions to make a playthrough more difficult
