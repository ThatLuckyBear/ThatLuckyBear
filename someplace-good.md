Someplace Good is a concept. It's mostly framed as a game but could just as easily be a short story or novel depending. This document will outline the concept, it's core direction and any other things that pop into mind.
# Concept
The concept is fairly simple. It's an "isekai" or "out of this world" scenario where the player is dropped into a near utopia. This "utopia" is genuine but atypical in that it is based on grounded but radical progressive concepts. Rather than a mystical enforcement that eliminates problems this society is held together socially. Here's a quick list:
- Typical need is solved by natural and constructed abundance. Everyone has more than they need and share accordingly.
  - includes housing
  - includes food
  - includes whatever really
  - even can include "wants" if there's more than enough to go around
- Work is not required of anyone for any reason.
- No money, and bartering is optional too if someone can reasonably give what you need.
As a result of these principles the elderly, disabled, and otherwise indeposed are not at odds with the horrors of not working people face so often in society. Also these people are not treated as less than or questioned or otherwise made to felt othered. Every day is a mental health day because nobody cares what you do.
