# Concept
A productivity system that leverages the power of parallel work (body doubling) to help users achieve goals of any size that utilizes a "soulslike" interactivity that lets users feel the presence of other users without interacting with them directly minimizing distraction while maximizing connection.

# Essential Functions
- must sucessfully tap into the benefits of parallel working
  - low distraction, high value interactivity
- must give users sense of community, belonging, and solidarity
  - feels natural to share success or failure
- must be open ended to accomodate small and large goals

# Stretch Functions
- GUI that resembles a isometric world like Tunic

# Prototype Ideas

## Three Phase
In the Three Phase concept the session will be broken up into 3 distinct phases.
  1. Warm Up
  2. Do
  3. Cooldown

Each phase will have it's own purpose and will give the user time to ease in to and out of their work for the day.

#### Warm Up
Warm up will start when the user logs in. First they'll see a cloud of users that are also logged in at the same time which fade quickly. Then they set a goal, possibly from a preset they've made to minimize tinkering traps and enter the "lobby." While not a real lobby this phase will let the user interact with others for a short time. 60 seconds perhaps. During this time the user will see the goals of other users who are also in a session and will have an opportunity to drop a small encouragement on it in the form of a heart or like etc. A countdown will encourage the user to drink water, take their meds, focus their minds, and get ready to do the thing.

#### Do
During the work phase the system will be pushed to the background with little to no visual elements to minimize distraction. When encouragement is given to their task a small audio will play reminding the user they are not alone and are working alongside others. Duration will be set according to the task by the user and will have it's own separate signal for when it's completed. This "finish" chime might be best left optional since some may want to keep the momentum while others would like to be "brought back." 

#### Cooldown
At the end of the Do phase the "lights" will come back on and users will be greeted with their completion screen. The system will ask them how their task went or to offer up a phrase to celebrate or lament how well they executed their "do" this session. Once a user gives their feedback they are greeted with the messages and feedback of others and are again able to offer encouragement but this time instead of a simple "like" they can respond with prebuilt phrases. This phrase doesn't have a time limit but may have a small bump reminder that they've been using the system for a while if it's been some time. 

Technically a phase 0 exists before a user interacts with the system itself where they can tinker with settings and create tasks and limits and of course offer feedback. Prebuilt surveys might be good to have available too epecially during testing phases. Users may want to lock themselves out of the settings pages by setting a time window where "this is when I want to be doing stuff" to prevent them from tinkering instead of utilizing the system.

# Glossary
session: the full length of time spent utilizing the system for any period  
system: general term used in place of "app" or "program" until the idea is given form
