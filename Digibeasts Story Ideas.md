## Cities
- Cities should have many metroidvania elements (blocked by upgrade) and lots of characters to interact with as well as exploration
## Environments
- 
## Characters
- The Main Protagonist is a fleshed out character not a blank slate for story telling.
  - Love interests, reasoning for their journey is sound and makes sense
  - As you explore you learn how the main character fits into the role of hero and despite being thrust into an unwanted role they take on the responsibility and see it through to the end.
- Party members instead of rivals we get party members who actually join your journey and control their own Digibeast.
  - Party members have affinities for certain types of beasts and can learn special moves for those affinities
  - They have their own personality and stakes
- Rival is a jerk
  - Not a friendly person, but not an evil person
  - Generally unlikeable (spoiled, nepotism?)
