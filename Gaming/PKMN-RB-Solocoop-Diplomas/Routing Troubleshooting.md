# Routing Ideas
- Catch Mew early and /use/ it
  - can use explosion to end fights early and use level underflow to hit level 100 and ensure you can reach any part of a fight without having to worry about RNG
- Skip badges/hall of fame by getting mewtwo via fly glitch?
  - Any other pokemon that require badges/hall of fame? What is in the cave?
  - Need to discover which is fastest but skipping hall of fame is almost certainly faster 
- Skip most catching until you have master/ultra balls + fly
- Missingno
  - If any of the missingno transform into a useful pokemon if caught: 1 does this properly add to the pokedex? 2 can they be traded?
  - Routing Missingno encounters?
  - Can you use whiteout to force more fly glitch missingnos?
- Abra/teleport backup
  - Trade to get mew and grab the teleport TM one east of cerulean after getting cut 
- Consider paralyze heals for rock tunnel oddish
- Compare time for Agatha Porygon vs “Nugget dupe> buy coins”
- Can Moltres be manip’d for fly encounters? if so what values?
- Faster to get free Eevee or triple reset off Samantha?
- Can you use psychic to lower the special of a mon to force a different fly glitch encounter?


# Major Challenges
- Dupe Pokemon Doesn’t Register to Pokedex
  - Trade required? 
  - If encountered does the pokedex show it as captured?
- Hard to obtain pokemon that will require trade/dupe/glitch
  - Bulbasaur (+evos)
  - Charmander (+evos)
  - Squirtle (+evos)
  - Eevee (+evos)
    - Sabrina's Kadabra spawns Eevee on fly glitch (first Mon, always?) But she needs to be talked to so black out on or beat a walking trainer before going to her (teleporters: top left, bottom right, bottom right)
  - Mew
    - Fly glitch is the only way, we get two mew. One level 1 and one level 100. Teach the level 1 mew fly, cut, dig and strength. Teach level 100 psychic, ice beam??? Else???
  - Golem
  - Machamp
  - Omanyte
  - Kabuto
- Pokemon with low encounter rate/high catch resistance
  - Chansey
  - Dratini
  - Articuno
  - Moltres
  - Zapdos
- Pokemon that are difficult due to exp tables (slow evolution)
  - Magikarp (gyrados)
  - Dragonair/Dragonite

# Solo Coop Challenges
## Desync/Resync Methods
Resync: Start menu icon can get off and you want to align the cursor
- Open item menu and press B quickly then move the cursor (fast menu) and repeat until aligned
- Choosing your trainer card has a good delay so it can help you resync
- Choosing save will freeze one menu and give you a chance to move the cursor on the other as well    

Dysync During Battle: Pokemon cries in menu will differ in length choose (stats) then mash B, one will almost always end up ahead
- Time it well and one cursor will be free on the menu while the other can do whatever it likes    

Trades when # of pokemon are uneven
- When you are trading back the pokemon go to the bottom and you can go to cancel and up one to get the “bottom” pokemon for both games

#### Fly Glitch Notes/Resources
Execution Tips & Strategy:
- Works if you blackout from wild encounter in front of a trainer (distance doesn’t matter)
- You can get access to your buttons by battling a walking trainer
  - Use this to get your buttons back for a safety save
  - Use this to enable the glitch to work on wild pokemon
  - If you whiteout on this battle you can preserve the trainer for future fly glitches.
    -  the one north of lavender is useful for this if your fly pokemon is lower level <30 or has self destruct.
    -  Walkthrough -- Fly away from gambler to Lavender, go north and lose to juggler, respawn at lavender, fly where you need to go and store your special stat, fly back to lavender, walk left > battle pokemon with stored index #
- If you KO and then exit battle that will store the special stat 
- [List of Pokemon by Index via Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_index_number_(Generation_I))
  - Use this list to catalog the index number of difficult to obtain pokemon and attempt to use this glitch to obtain them.
  - More in depth info on fly glitch ([link](http://www.psypokes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=26608))
More Pokemon to target: 
- Wild pokemon how many of them can be used to catch stuff that normally you’d miss? How to go about this?
  - Check with ditto?
  - Resources online that outline the spread of pokemon per route?
  - Probably need to do this by hand
  - wild pidgey outside forest can make Nidoking appear!
Special Stat:
  - The encountered pokemon from the glitch will be determined by the special stat of the last pokemon encountered.
  - Use a pokemon center very near the trainer you want to lift the special off of
  - Growth increases special attack can be used on a faster pokemon vs a ditto to target index #
Specific Pokemon
- Eveee
  - Sabrina's first Kadabra has a special of 102 (eevee's index)
  - Blackout vs Kadabra to store eevee special
    - self destruct works!
- Omanyte
  - First Trainer (to right) in Koga's Gym will give Omanyte
Fly
- After the battle you gain access to the start menu. You can fly to a location.
  - This makes the gambler on route 8 possibly the most efficient fly trainer
  - Fly to lavender and go left once = battle

#### SRAM Glitch
- used to dupe starters
- the “file data was destroyed” doesn’t delete the pokemon list saved so you can try to SRAM glitch again as soon as you spawn into the room on a new game.

#### Missingno (item underflow)
#### EXP Underflow
- level 100 Pokemon via fly glitch

#### RNG Manip Info
- Getting items and encountering trainers mess with RNG so don't play fast and loose with these
