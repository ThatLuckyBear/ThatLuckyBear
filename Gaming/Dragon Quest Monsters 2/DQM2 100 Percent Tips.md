## Important Monsters & Breeding Routes
Listed here are monsters you'll want quick access to as they're needed often for breeding across many different families.
- Metaldrak: Capture Andreal in SKY and breed with any MATERIAL monster.
- Kingslime: Capture in SKY
- Bosstroll: Capture in LIMBO
- Roboster: Capture GRIZZLY in ICE and breed with any MATERIAL

Getting access to a BOSS world key will make an enormous difference in routing and completion of the library as breeding to Dracolord1 is difficult despite being the "easiest" boss to get unless you have really easy access to a Servant due to something something.

## random tips
- Sky has so many important monsters. use a log twig by the middle castle so you can go with to catch Andreal and Kingslime, north for exp from metaly and gigantes. gate guards in the lower levels of spooky castle
- Rest at inns to reset over world items because you'll get most money from selling elf water and staffs
- you can tame monsters from monster masters with sirloin look out for rosevine, metalking, akubar and others
- Roboster can learn pheromone which is like whistle or shiny harp but makes wild monsters be the opposite gender. great for monsters like boss troll who almost always spawn male in the wild (I haven't seen an female bosstroll yet anyway)
- Informer is a good skill for scouting in key worlds and verifying if you're in the right spot for what you're hunting mine is on Granslime
- shiny harp is infinite use so buy it to save time menuing for whistle

## random tips for cheaters 
please correct me on this info if you have conflicting experience, these are not "code confirmed" only tested by hand
- recruit chance is rolled at end of turn inputs so you can save state at "enemy" or "fight" (if they're already hit with meat) and reload until the capture happens. The last choice from player is the point of no return so saving just as the monster dies will not yield different results on reload.
- gender is rolled at start of battle so no matter how many times you reset mid-battle it'll never change
- roaming monster tamers roll their team when the battle starts so you can save state at the "yes/no" choice and get different teams each time you reload
- Casino ships play fair so if you save state on each reel you can get 3 stars every time for a free meteorb
