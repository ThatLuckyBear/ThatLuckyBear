## Important Monsters & Breeding Routes
Listed here are monsters you'll want quick access to as they're needed often for breeding across many different families.

#### Breeding Boss Route 

- Metaldrak: Capture Andreal in SKY and breed with any MATERIAL monster.
  - used for up to ~15 different breeding paths
- Kingslime: Capture in SKY
  - used in ~7 breeding paths
  - Can be combined with Metaldrak for a Metalking which is used in ~9 breeding paths
- Bosstroll: Capture in LIMBO
  - Used in ~8 breeding paths
  - Can be combined with *BEAST to make Centasaur which is used in ~7 very limited breeding paths lime Durran and Lavaman (metaldrak + Bosstroll!)
- Roboster: Capture GRIZZLY in ICE and breed with any MATERIAL
  - ~15 breeding paths
  - easy access to pheramone for forcing gender for field captures
  - can be used for ICEMAN which is important for some limited breeding paths

#### Wild/Capturable Monsters to look out for or keep in eggs til you need them:
- Darkhorn (get at least 2, if not 3)
  - extremely limited breeding options for some monsters
  - requires a *Boss to breed so very useful for filling out library if you can catch one instead of breeding.
  - Titanis and Gorago require a Darkhorn but if you keep the Gorago you can use it for Modou saving yourself some trouble
- Divinegon (get 3 or 4)
  - used for bosses and other monsters and kind of a pain to breed without easy access to Orochi
  - Required for Pizzaro (boss), Dracolord2(boss), and Orligon (Dragon)
  - You need 2 Pizzaro to finish the library at minimum so that's at least 4 Divinegon needed

## key hunting with save states
- to get more chances at a key use master battles in worlds and save at the last text before "got key"
- reroll until you get the key and save a new slot and reset for another key and it will be different
- check each one until you get what you want
- keys cycle through keys you've never had before dropping the same one again so you can use this to force the pool to narrow to reroll the same key to try and get a "LastBsmt" or whatever you want/need
- When key hunting use the highest level and most rare monsters to execute the battle. Check library and aim for 4 star rarity for all 3 members of your team.

## Bard Farming
- the pool of monsters that bards use on their team seems to be the exact same as the last standard master you battle
- the most important pool for boss tree breeding (especially like PIZZARO and Psychopizz) is the Goldgolem/GoldSlime/Divinegon/Emyru/etc. monster pool
- some worlds don't seem to ever spawn regular masters (ie: priest/bard/ripoff merchant) --- my world was MistyLord
- if you battle a regular (red or orange) master and then go to your Bard Only world you can save state just before the battle starts and reroll from the guaranteed monsters in that pool until you get what you need
- Warning; I always had a level 99 Granslime with me so I don't know how this effects the spawns but it was consistent and I was able to replicate it with different monsters too but this mechanic is not fully explored 

## random tips
- Sky has so many important monsters. use a log twig by the middle castle so you can go with to catch Andreal and Kingslime, north for exp from metaly and gigantes. gate guards in the lower levels of spooky castle
- Rest at inns to reset over world items because you'll get most money from selling elf water and staffs
- you can tame monsters from monster masters with sirloin look out for rosevine, metalking, akubar and others
- Roboster can learn pheromone which is like whistle or shiny harp but makes wild monsters be the opposite gender. great for monsters like boss troll who almost always spawn male in the wild (I haven't seen an female bosstroll yet anyway)
- Informer is a good skill for scouting in key worlds and verifying if you're in the right spot for what you're hunting mine is on Granslime
- shiny harp is infinite use so buy it to save time menuing for whistle

## random tips for cheaters 
please correct me on this info if you have conflicting experience, these are not "code confirmed" only tested by hand
- recruit chance is rolled at end of turn inputs so you can save state at "enemy" or "fight" (if they're already hit with meat) and reload until the capture happens. The last choice from player is the point of no return so saving just as the monster dies will not yield different results on reload.
- gender is rolled at start of battle so no matter how many times you reset mid-battle it'll never change
- roaming monster tamers roll their team when the battle starts so you can save state at the "yes/no" choice and get different teams each time you reload
- Casino ships play fair so if you save state on each reel you can get 3 stars every time for a free meteorb
