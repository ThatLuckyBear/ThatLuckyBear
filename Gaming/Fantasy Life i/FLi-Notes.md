Making drop % gear set for all plan:
- Charm doesn't need applique but glasses and cape does.
- charm, specs, cape, and shield can roll %10
- glove, hat, chest, legs, and shoes can only get %5 so double rolls = done


For teammates make a low tier charm with lots of items in stock until you have 3x charms with drop %10 at least once. 
Remake those 3 until you have 10%x2 on all 3.
Repeat with low tier glasses 
Repeat with low tier cape
Repeat with low tier shield
_____________ this sets you at %80 drop for all 3 companions (%240 total with no drop % on self
) 

For Self slate gear: apocalypse, dark beast, steel best, driving, black magic, sultan 
don't use robes since it uses two slots so you can have chest and legs
