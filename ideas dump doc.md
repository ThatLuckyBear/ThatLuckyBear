# Cursed: Frogged Forever
a witch curses a human to become a frog. turns out being a frog is great and they begin to enjoy the freedom immediately. realizing their mistake the witch begins to frantically attempt to undo the curse by any means. our hero (the frog) has to avoid the traps and pitfalls of the witch to keep their new happy froggy life from being undone.
a fortune teller (form undecided) helps maintain the perspective and stakes of "being human is bad" for players.
