## Crow With a Coin
a juvenile crow has a note tied to it's leg and a single coin. They must journey all the way to the alchemist to make an order for their master, a somewhat delusional witch. Emboldened with a pat on the head and the witches confidence in them the small crow starts their journey. There's only one problem, the coin is too heavy for them to fly with it in their beak.
Puzzle game that tasks a player to get their coin past obstacles by solving convouluted social and/or physics based puzzles. Players will set down their coin somewhere safe and figure out how to communicate with people and/or animals who don't speak crow, get past troubling terrain that threatens to dislodge the coin, or avoid prowling thieves and predators in the night. 

**Puzzle Ideas**
- drop a coin in a walking person's pocket and pull a string on their pants to get the coin back out
- short change scam a shady merchant by insisting you paid with 3 gold coins and 1 silver not 1 gold 4 silver and he owes you back
- use a string to get a cat to move into sight of a cat hunter who will chase the cat freeing up your path
- creating a coin tube from a destructed plastic hamster tunnel system
- borrow a trebuchet and somehow work it's mechanisms despite being a small bird
- lead a prison break
- organize a poisonous snakes union who subsequently strike (literally)
- Befriend an old God who was believed to have abandoned a city
- Befriend a small child who needs help making new friends (the old God obviously would be a wonderful friend)
- solve an impossible riddle with an impossible solution

**Gameplay**
A mix between Monkey Island and a 3d platformer. Players can fly if the find a safe place for their coin but it will get stolen if left without consideration for too long. Flying can reveal the next area which can be explored for clues and resources and can help clue players in on how to get their coin in. Sometimes you can talk directly with creatures or people, other times they'll attempt to communicate with a unique mini game. Each area progressively gets sillier and also adds more requirements before opening the way. Eventually the player will need contend with more dynamic circumstances like being in the middle of a battle and navigating the chaos.


## Cursed: Frogged Forever
a witch curses a human to become a frog. turns out being a frog is great and they begin to enjoy the freedom immediately. realizing their mistake the witch begins to frantically attempt to undo the curse by any means. our hero (the frog) has to avoid the traps and pitfalls of the witch to keep their new happy froggy life from being undone.
a fortune teller (form undecided) helps maintain the perspective and stakes of "being human is bad" for players.
- possible chapters:
- - princesses kiss
  - true love
  - magic potion
  - frog bullies
  - sower of doubt (serpent in the garden)
  - murder (here comes a predator)
  - fighting back (get the witches license revoked for doing too much kindness ie: "helping" the frog.)
 
## Eternal Rogue like
semi randomized game where you play as an immortal locked in combat with an eternal serpent.
the player character sacrifices their life and becomes immortal to interlock with the eternal serpent and keep it too busy to attack the inhabitants of the world
every run makes years go by and after a few thousand your rivalry becomes comraderie and a 3rd party starts trying to interrupt your battle to get the serpent to return to razing the earth
dialogue drops and story beats handles similar to Hades but with "x years have passed" between runs
brainstormed ideas
- if you "win" a run it passes more years which is the goal (keep monster busy)
- monster reshapes itself to create the dungeon that the player is fighting through, monsters and such "spring" from the serpent
- as their comraderie builds they start being happy with each other "wow great run" instead of "I will destroy you a thousand times!"
- particularly short runs might be encouraging "you can do better" or "is everything okay?"
- 3rd party wants to take the immortals attention off the serpent and adds a bunch of extra obstacles to try and shorten runs
- finale would be defeating the 3rd party and resuming their eternal battle happily
- serpent steals their ideas to try and beat the player in a post game "hard mode" with more story beats

## Series of Tubes
metroid-like where the player, while travelling in their spaceship, gets transported suddenly by a portal to an unknown planet. Now stranded the player needs to repair their ship and figure out the mystery of the portals to escape.

core gimmick is that the game allows players to scout out nearby planets and enter them using their ship like areas but only ONCE. after that they need to find the portal membrane and pass through it to link back to the original planet thus connecting the planets as if they were just different areas in a standard metroidvania map. this allows players to suspend disbelief while creating opportunities for interesting interactions between normally separate ecosystems.

### ideas for membrane connections and areas: 
- why go to new planets? there are materials or parts for the ship found by scanning that will aid in repairing the ship
- connecting ecosystems allows animal from planet A to remove animal from planet B (super cruncher jaw monster eats invincible shelled monster blocking path)
- connecting allows plants to grow into area changing it to allow climbing gaps
- connecting has animal go on hyper mode by being exposed to new plants/foods and becomes boss level problem
- dropping an item from A>B planet activates switch
- since ship is stranded each time it moves securing the parts you need requires a backtracking puzzle to bring the part back
- stranded ship but when you go through the membrane you can't make it back without a power up even if you have the next part you need
- each planet feeds into the "Central" planet that originally captured the player and connecting the membranes is actually feeding the final boss/big bad
- the enemies that have been trying to stop you (introduced midway through game space pirates) are trying to stop the big bad from waking up
- some planets are inhabited and will absolutely be against fucking with the portal membrane. rogue factions of the same planet will help you.

## Someplace Good

The concept is fairly simple. It's an "isekai" or "out of this world" scenario where the player is dropped into a near utopia. This "utopia" is genuine but atypical in that it is based on grounded but radical progressive concepts. Rather than a mystical enforcement that eliminates problems this society is held together socially. Here's a quick list:

#### Typical need is solved by natural and constructed abundance. Everyone has more than they need and share accordingly.
  - includes housing
  - includes food
  - includes whatever really
  - even can include "wants" if there's more than enough to go around
  - Work is not required of anyone for any reason.
  - No money, and bartering is optional too if someone can reasonably give what you need. As a result of these principles the elderly, disabled, and otherwise indeposed are not at odds with the horrors of not working people face so often in society.
  - Also these people are not treated as less than or questioned or otherwise made to felt othered.
  - Every day is a mental health day because nobody cares what you do.

#### Enter "player"
  - Player choices can really fuck things up for the utopia
  - Game is framed as "you can introduce capitalism to this world and prosper!"
    - this is the bad ending but its not obvious that you're the bad guy until it's too late
  - Player can pain stakingly work within and embrace the culture and it's a 10x harder game but the good ending is locked behind this path
