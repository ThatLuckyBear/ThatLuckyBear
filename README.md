I like video games.
I'm a dad and a creative guy.
I want to make interesting and cool art across many genres and mediums.
Music, code, digital painting, game dev, writing, and more.

Projects:

thatluckybear.com | thatluckybear.neocities.org - my web blog where I post written articles of varying subject mostly related to gaming, learning game dev & code, and philosophy. ultimately I'd my web content to be video audio text. written articles would have audio version embedded and a YouTube version of the same concept/idea/guide.

youtube.com/thatluckybear - my Youtube channel where I upload (sometimes) videos about gaming

twitch.tv/thatluckybear - my Twitch channel where I livestream a variety of games and hope to return to soon

gamedev - I'm trying my hand at learning Godot, Python(GDScript), and a few other workflow tools

writing - Not only do I write articles for my blog but I also write fiction usually in the form of novels. My games will have written stories as well although less detailed than a novel would be.

voice acting - I am a professional voice actor who mostly works with audiobooks. I hope to one day have an online portfolio for my work. The dream is to voice games and/or anime.

music - I am a composer at heart despite having very limited skills. I love composing music and hope to compose my own games one day.
